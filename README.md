This is a ML project that seeks to understand the relationship between school/family resources (e.g. teacher-to-student ratio, average family monthly income, etc.) and average STAR testing results, then makes predictions based on different levels of resources. To run the code, you must have certain statistical packages, but they should be easy to install if neccessary. The project first seeks the ML prediction method with the best out-of-sample predictive ability, then makes the prediction using the best performing model. 

Included is the code, as well as the analysis paper, which summarizes the findings and methods of the project.
